You should learn some things about queues when you write this program.  In particular,
you should learn that <p>

queues are FIFO data structures <p>
adding to a queue is called "enqueue"<p>
enqueues always happen at the end of the queue <p>
removing an item from a queue is called "dequeue"<p>
dequeues always happen at the fron of the queue <p>
like stacks, you can't add to a full queue <p>
like stacks, you can't remove something from an empty queue <p>
